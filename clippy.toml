# Industry Standard Thresholds:
# - Cognitive complexity: 0-5 good, 6-15 warning, 16+ refactor
# - Cyclomatic complexity: 1-10 good, 11-20 warning, 21+ refactor
# - Lines per function: <25 good, 25-50 warning, 50+ refactor
# - Function arguments: 0-4 good, 5-6 warning, 7+ refactor
#
# These thresholds are set slightly above "good" to reduce noise while
# still catching genuinely problematic code.

# Cognitive complexity (mental effort to understand code)
# Default: 25, Industry "needs attention": 15
# Set to 30 to accommodate existing code; tighten as functions are refactored
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Maximum lines in a function before triggering too_many_lines
# Default: 100, Industry "should refactor": 50
too-many-lines-threshold = 100

# Maximum function arguments before triggering too_many_arguments
# Default: 7, Industry "too many": 7
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Type complexity (nested generics, etc.)
# Default: 250
type-complexity-threshold = 300

# Maximum nesting depth (if/match/loop)
# Default: 0 (disabled), Industry "complex": 4-5
# Disabled for now - too aggressive for typical Rust patterns
excessive-nesting-threshold = 0

# Disallow common placeholder names in non-test code
disallowed-names = ["foo", "bar", "baz", "quux"]

# Single character names allowed (loop counters, etc.)
